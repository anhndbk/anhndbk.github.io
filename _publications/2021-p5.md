title: "A survey on adverse drug reaction studies: data, tasks and machine learning methods"

excerpt: "<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
Motivation: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) or drug side effect studies play a crucial role in drug discovery. Recently, with the rapid increase of both clinical and non-clinical data, machine learning methods have emerged as prominent tools to support analyzing and predicting ADRs. Nonetheless, there are still remaining challenges in ADR studies. Results: In this paper, we summarized ADR data sources and review ADR studies in three tasks: drug-ADR benchmark data creation, drug-ADR prediction and ADR mechanism analysis. We focused on machine learning methods used in each task and then compare performances of the methods on the drug-ADR prediction task. Finally, we discussed open problems for further ADR studies.
