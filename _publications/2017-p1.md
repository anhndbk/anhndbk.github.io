Exploiting prior knowledge in the Bayesian learning process is one way to improve the quality of Bayesian model. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no formal research about the influence of prior in streaming environment. In this paper, we address the problem of using prior knowledge in streaming Bayesian learning, and develop a framework for keeping priors in streaming learning (KPS) that maintains knowledge from the prior through each minibatch of streaming data. We demonstrate the performance of our framework in two scenarios: streaming learning for latent Dirichlet allocation and streaming text classification in comparison with methods that do not keep prior.

Exploiting prior knowledge in the Bayesian learning process is one way to improve the quality of Bayesian model. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no formal research about the influence of prior in streaming environment. In this paper, we address the problem of using prior knowledge in streaming Bayesian learning, and develop a framework for keeping priors in streaming learning (KPS) that maintains knowledge from the prior through each minibatch of streaming data. We demonstrate the performance of our framework in two scenarios: streaming learning for latent Dirichlet allocation and streaming text classification in comparison with methods that do not keep prior.
