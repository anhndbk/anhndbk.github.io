To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no formal research about the influence of prior in streaming environment. In this paper, we address the problem of using prior knowledge in streaming Bayesian learning, and develop a framework for keeping priors in streaming learning (KPS) that maintains knowledge from the prior through each minibatch of streaming data. We demonstrate the performance of our framework in two scenarios: streaming learning for latent Dirichlet allocation and streaming text classification in comparison with methods that do not keep prior.

13/05/2020	Neural Poisson Factorization	IEEE Access	In this work, we focus on dealing with a sparse users feedback matrix and short descriptions/contents of items in recommender systems. We propose the Neural Poisson factorization (NPF) model which is a hybrid of deep learning and Poisson factorization. While Poisson factorization is suitable to model discrete, massive and sparse feedback, using a deep neural network and pre-trained word embeddings can learn hidden semantic in short item descriptions well. Therefore, NPF overcomes the limitation of existing models when dealing with short texts and a sparse feedback matrix. Moreover, we develop a random view algorithm based on stochastic learning for our model, in which each user is only viewed a random subset of items and his/her feedback on the subset is used to update his/her representation in each iteration. This approach is reasonable because each user can only know or view a partial subset of items when surfing a system. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant advantages of NPF over content-based matrix factorization methods and others that ignore item descriptions.

01/02/2021	Boosting prior knowledge in streaming variational bayes	Neurocomputing	Exploiting prior/human knowledge is an effective way to enhance Bayesian models, especially in cases of sparse or noisy data, for which building an entirely new model is not always possible. There is a lack of studies on the effect of external prior knowledge in streaming environments, where the data come sequentially and infinitely. In this work, we show the problem of vanishing prior knowledge in streaming variational Bayes. This is a serious drawback in various applications. We then develop a simple framework to boost the external prior when learning a Bayesian model from data streams. By boosting, the prior knowledge can be maintained and efficiently exploited through each minibatch of streaming data. We evaluate the performance of our framework in four scenarios: streaming in synthetic data, streaming sentiment analysis, streaming learning for latent Dirichlet allocation, and streaming text classification	"Duc Anh Nguyen, Kim Anh Nguyen, Canh Hao Nguyen, and Khoat Than.

31/12/2021	Dynamic transformation of prior knowledge into Bayesian models for data streams	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	We consider how to effectively use prior knowledge when learning a Bayesian model from streaming environments where the data come endlessly and sequentially. This problem is highly important in the era of data explosion and rich sources of valuable external knowledge such as pre-trained models, ontologies, Wikipedia, etc. We show that some existing approaches can forget any knowledge very fast. We then propose a novel framework that enables to incorporate the prior knowledge of different forms into a base Bayesian model for data streams. Our framework subsumes some existing popular models for time-series/dynamic data. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing methods with a large margin. In particular, our framework can help Bayesian models generalize well on extremely short text while other methods overfit.	"Tran, Bach, Duc Anh Nguyen, Linh Ngo Van, and Khoat Than.

10/01/2021	A survey on adverse drug reaction studies: data, tasks and machine learning methods	Briefings in Bioinformatics	Motivation: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) or drug side effect studies play a crucial role in drug discovery. Recently, with the rapid increase of both clinical and non-clinical data, machine learning methods have emerged as prominent tools to support analyzing and predicting ADRs. Nonetheless, there are still remaining challenges in ADR studies. Results: In this paper, we summarized ADR data sources and review ADR studies in three tasks: drug-ADR benchmark data creation, drug-ADR prediction and ADR mechanism analysis. We focused on machine learning methods used in each task and then compare performances of the methods on the drug-ADR prediction task. Finally, we discussed open problems for further ADR studies.

The state-of-the-art methods for DDI prediction use hypergraph neural networks to learn latent representations of drugs and side effects to express high-order relationships among two interacting drugs and a side effect. The idea of these methods is that each side effect is caused by a unique combination of latent features of the corresponding interacting drugs. However, in reality, a side effect might have multiple, different mechanisms that cannot be represented by a single combination of latent features of drugs. Moreover, DDI data are sparse, suggesting that using a sparsity regularization would help to learn better latent representations to improve prediction performances. Results: We propose SPARSE, which encodes the DDI hypergraph and drug features to latent spaces to learn multiple types of combinations of latent features of drugs and side effects, controlling the model sparsity by a sparse prior. Our extensive experiments using both synthetic and three real-world DDI datasets showed the clear predictive performance advantage of SPARSE over cutting-edge competing methods. Also, latent feature analysis over unknown top predictions by SPARSE demonstrated the interpretability advantage contributed by the model sparsity.

03/04/2023	Central-Smoothing Hypergraph Neural Networks for Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	Predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is the problem of predicting side effects (unwanted outcomes) of a pair of drugs using drug information and known side effects of many pairs. This problem can be formulated as predicting labels (i.e., side effects) for each pair of nodes in a DDI graph, of which nodes are drugs and edges are interacting drugs with known labels. State-of-the-art methods for this problem are graph neural networks (GNNs), which leverage neighborhood information in the graph to learn node representations. For DDI, however, there are many labels with complicated relationships due to the nature of side effects. Usual GNNs often fix labels as one-hot vectors that do not reflect label relationships and potentially do not obtain the highest performance in the difficult cases of infrequent labels. In this brief, we formulate DDI as a hypergraph where each hyperedge is a triple: two nodes for drugs and one node for a label. We then present CentSmoothie , a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) that learns representations of nodes and labels altogether with a novel central-smoothing formulation. We empirically demonstrate the performance advantages of CentSmoothie in simulations as well as real datasets.	"Duc Anh Nguyen, C. H. Nguyen and H.

22/09/2014	Reordering dimensions for Radial Visualization of multidimensional data-A Genetic Algorithms approach	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	In this paper, we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for solving the problem of dimensional ordering in Radial Visualization (Radviz) systems. The Radviz is a non-linear projection of high-dimensional data set onto two dimensional space. The order of dimension anchors in the Radviz system is crucial for the visualization quality. We conducted experiments on five common data sets and compare the quality of solutions found by GA and those found by the other well-known methods. The experimental results show that the solutions found by GA for these tested data sets are very competitive having better cost values than almost all solutions found by other methods. This suggests that GA could be a good approach to solve the problem of dimensional ordering in Radviz.	"H. T. Thanh Binh, T. Van Long, N. X. Hoai, Duc Anh Nguyen and P. M.
